## About
This is a side project to poll for new matches for pubg players, format, and post them to discord.

Currently, the project is in alpha testing and only functions on my server.

## Goals

1. My primary goal is to test out technologies and learn.
2. Secondarily I would like to make it so this service could be added to any discord server, allow players to register, and send post game reports.
